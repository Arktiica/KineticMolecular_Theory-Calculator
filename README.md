# KineticMolecular_Theory-Calculator

Calculation the Root mean square speed (u_rms) and Average Kinetic Energy (KE_avg) based on the 2 user inputs. **There are no checks for input errors**:
- Inputting temperature as celsius will give you an incorrect calcuation.
- Inputting anything more than numbers will return a value error.

> Gas Constant being used: 8.314 J/K-mol
>
> Temperature must need to be inputted in Kelvin.
>
> Molar mass must need to be inputted in grams per mole.

Celsius -> Kelvin
â„ƒ + 273.15 = K

How To Use:
1. Download the `.py` file and run it.
2. Input values without units.
3. Returns the calculation results. And asks if you want to stop calculating.
4. Enter `y` to quit or enter `n` to calculate again.
