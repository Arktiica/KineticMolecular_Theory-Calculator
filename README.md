# KineticMolecular_Theory-Calculator

Calculates the root mean square speed (u_rms) and Average Kinetic Energy (KE_avg) based on the 2 user inputs. **There are no checks for input errors**:
- Inputting temperature as celsius will give you an incorrect calcuation.
- Inputting anything more than numbers will return a value error.

Gas Constant being used: 8.314 J/K-mol<br>
Temperature must need to be inputted in Kelvin. (â„ƒ + 273.15 = K)<br>
Molar mass must need to be inputted in grams per mole. <br>
Celsius -> Kelvin


Wanted to make my life easier, and also re-learn a lanuage I've not touched in awhile. Simple yet effective.
